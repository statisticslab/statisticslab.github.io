I am an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) within the [Public Health Sciences Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/public-health-sciences-division.html). I am also an Affiliate faculty in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/faculty) at the University of Washington. I am broadly interested in network biology and high-dimensional data analysis, motivated by important problems in genomics and neuroscience. My work has appeared in Annals of Statistics, Annals of Applied Statistics, Biometrika, Bioinformatics, among many other peer-reviewed journals. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and my Ph.D. in Statistics from [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) where I worked under the supervision of Dr. [George Michailidis](https://informatics.research.ufl.edu/homepage/about-us/michailidis.html). Before coming to Fred Hutch, I was a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. [Hongzhe Li](http://statgene.med.upenn.edu/) and Dr. [Tony Cai](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/) at the University of Pennsylvania.   

My Chinese name is 马静. I am originally from [Shangqiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangqiu), an ancient city in central China.
