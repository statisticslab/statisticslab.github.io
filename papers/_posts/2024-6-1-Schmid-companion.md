# Abstract

Inflammaging, the chronic, progressive proinflammatory state associated with aging, has been associated with multiple negative health outcomes in humans. The pathophysiology of inflammaging is complex; however, it is often characterized by high serum concentrations of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Few studies have evaluated the effects of age on inflammatory cytokines in companion dogs, and most of these studies included dogs of a single breed. In this cross-sectional study, we measured multiple circulating inflammatory markers and hematological parameters in banked serum samples from 47 healthy companion dogs of various breeds enrolled in the Dog Aging Project. Using univariate linear models, we investigated the association of each of these markers with age, sex, body weight, and body condition score (BCS), a measure of obesity in the dog. Serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α concentrations were all positively associated with age. Lymphocyte count was negatively associated with age. Platelet count had a negative association with body weight. IL-2, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, bilirubin, S100A12, and NMH concentrations were not associated with age, weight, BCS, or sex after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Our findings replicate previous findings in humans, including increases in IL-6 and TNF-α with age, giving more evidence to the strength of the companion dog as a model for human aging.
