Jing received an award from The [Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/translational-data-science-integrated-research-center.html) for the pilot project on "Systems biology analysis of the immunomodulatory influence of circulating gut microbe-derived metabolites after transplantation". 

This project is in collaboration with Dr. [Kate Markey](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/markey-kate.html), and will analyze a novel blood sample-derived data set. Collected from patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, these samples have already been analyzed using state of the art flow cytometry and metabolomics methods. We now aim to a) develop new understanding of the links between microbial metabolites and immune function, and b) develop novel computational approaches to analyze these types of data sets.
