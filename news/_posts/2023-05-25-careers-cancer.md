I was recently invited to write about careers in Biostatistics for high school students interested in careers in STEM and healthcare. If you are curious about careers in Biostatistics or cancer research, please check out [this article](https://sites.google.com/sciedhutch.org/careerprofiles-frontiers-intro/home/biostatistician). Huge thanks to Kristen Bergsman who helped write the article!
