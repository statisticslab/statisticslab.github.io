I was a guest speaker in the seminar series course [STAT/BIOST 111](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/academics/courses/BIOST/111) at the University of Washington, where I gave a talk on [Statistical Modeling for Enhanced Microbiome Biomarker Discovery](/assets/pdfs/talks/2024-04-24-Stat.pdf). This talk explains how to perform principled statistical inference for high-dimensional regression where samples and variables are correlated. For more details, check out [our paper](/papers/GMDR) published in Annals of Applied Statistics.
