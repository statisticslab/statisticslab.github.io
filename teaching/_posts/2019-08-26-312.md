STAT312 is an introduction to statistical learning methods for biological applications. The course will cover topics such as generative models for count data, statistical modeling, clustering, hypothesis testing, multivariate analysis, classification and regression, experimental design, and teach students how to use existing software tools in R to visualize and analyze biological data.

Course materials are available on Texas A&M University eCampus or [GitHub](https://github.com/drjingma/Courses/tree/master/Stat312).
