I was a guest speaker in the Wellcome Genome Campus Advanced Course "[Genetic Analysis of Mendelian and Complex Disorders](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/genetic-analysis-of-mendelian-and-complex-disorders-virtual-20220722/)", where I gave a (virtual) talk on [Statistical Methods for Analysis of Correlated Data](/assets/pdfs/talks/2022-07-27-Genetics.pdf). This talk features a computationally efficient method for estimating variance components in linear mixed models. The method is illustrated on two examples, one on genome-wide association analysis and the other on gene set analysis. For more details about the method, check out [this paper](/papers/REHE).
